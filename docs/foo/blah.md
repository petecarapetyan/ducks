# CRUD - Team Reps

CRUD is what most of us will be hired for, when we graduate.

In CRUD Team Reps we take what Trevor and the assignments teach us, and use these skills over and over on simple CRUD webapps until they become rote, even boring.

The bad news is that most of this stuff doesn't get easy or natural until you've done it the 10th time :(

The good news is that it DOES get a LOT faster to do, even on the second and third time. So those additional reps can go quickly, especially if you're doing it together as a team.
